### Morpho-logic from a Topos Perspective: Application to symbolic AI
**source**: arXiv:2303.04895 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04895)]  
**abstract**: Modal logics have proved useful for many reasoning tasks in symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), such as belief revision, spatial reasoning, among others. On the other hand, mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory for non-linear analysis of structures, that was widely developed and applied in image analysis. Its mathematical bases rely on algebra, complete lattices, topology. Strong links have been established between MM and mathematical logics, mostly modal logics. In this paper, we propose to further develop and generalize this link between mathematical morphology and modal logic from a topos perspective, i.e. categorial structures generalizing space, and connecting logics, sets and topology. Furthermore, we rely on the internal language and logic of topos. We define structuring elements, dilations and erosions as morphisms. Then we introduce the notion of structuring neighborhoods, and show that the dilations and erosions based on them lead to a constructive modal logic, for which a sound and complete proof system is proposed. We then show that the modal logic thus defined (called morpho-logic here), is well adapted to define concrete and efficient operators for revision, merging, and abduction of new knowledge, or even spatial reasoning.  

### Sparse and Local Networks for Hypergraph Reasoning
**source**: arXiv:2303.05496 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05496)]  
**abstract**: Reasoning about the relationships between entities from input facts (e.g., whether Ari is a grandparent of Charlie) generally requires explicit consideration of other entities that are not mentioned in the query (e.g., the parents of Charlie). In this paper, we present an approach for learning to solve problems of this kind in large, real-world domains, using sparse and local hypergraph neural networks (SpaLoc). SpaLoc is motivated by two observations from traditional logic-based reasoning: relational inferences usually apply locally (i.e., involve only a small number of individuals), and relations are usually sparse (i.e., only hold for a small percentage of tuples in a domain). We exploit these properties to make learning and inference efficient in very large domains by (1) using a sparse tensor representation for hypergraph neural networks, (2) applying a sparsification loss during training to encourage sparse representations, and (3) subsampling based on a novel information sufficiency-based sampling process during training. SpaLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world, large-scale knowledge graph reasoning benchmarks, and is the first framework for applying hypergraph neural networks on real-world knowledge graphs with more than 10k nodes.  

### MathPrompter: Mathematical Reasoning using Large Language Models
**source**: arXiv:2303.05398 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05398)]  
**abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have limited performance when solving arithmetic reasoning tasks and often provide incorrect answers. Unlike natural language understanding, math problems typically have a single correct answer, making the task of generating accurate solutions more challenging for LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any LLMs that indicate their level of confidence in their responses which fuels a trust deficit in these models impeding their adoption. To address this deficiency, we propose `MathPrompter', a technique that improves performance of LLMs on arithmetic problems along with increased reliance in the predictions. MathPrompter uses the Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple Algebraic expressions or Python functions to solve the same math problem in different ways and thereby raise the confidence level in the output results. This is in contrast to other prompt based CoT methods, where there is no check on the validity of the intermediate steps followed. Our technique improves over state-of-the-art on the MultiArith dataset ($78.7\%\rightarrow92.5\%$) evaluated using 175B parameter GPT-based LLM.  

### Visual Abstraction and Reasoning through Language
**source**: arXiv:2303.04091 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04091)]  
**abstract**: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have achieved human or even superhuman performance in narrowly defined applications, they still struggle to show signs of broader and more flexible intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), introduced by Fran√ßois Chollet, aims to assess how close AI systems are to human-like cognitive abilities. Most current approaches rely on carefully handcrafted domain-specific languages (DSLs), which are used to brute-force solutions to the tasks present in ARC. In this work, we propose a general framework for solving ARC based on natural language descriptions of the tasks. While not yet beating state-of-the-art DSL models on ARC, we demonstrate the immense potential of our approach hinted at by the ability to solve previously unsolved tasks.  

### Neural Compositional Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning
**source**: arXiv:2303.03581 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03581)]  
**abstract**: Learning logical rules is critical to improving reasoning in KGs. This is due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations when used for predictions, as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks, domains, and data. While recent methods have been proposed to learn logical rules, the majority of these methods are either restricted by their computational complexity and can not handle the large search space of large-scale KGs, or show poor generalization when exposed to data outside the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural model for learning compositional logical rules called NCRL. NCRL detects the best compositional structure of a rule body, and breaks it into small compositions in order to infer the rule head. By recurrently merging compositions in the rule body with a recurrent attention unit, NCRL finally predicts a single rule head. Experimental results show that NCRL learns high-quality rules, as well as being generalizable. Specifically, we show that NCRL is scalable, efficient, and yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion on large-scale KGs. Moreover, we test NCRL for systematic generalization by learning to reason on small-scale observed graphs and evaluating on larger unseen ones.  

### Document-level Relation Extraction with Cross-sentence Reasoning Graph
**source**: arXiv:2303.03912 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03912)]  
**abstract**: Relation extraction (RE) has recently moved from the sentence-level to document-level, which requires aggregating document information and using entities and mentions for reasoning. Existing works put entity nodes and mention nodes with similar representations in a document-level graph, whose complex edges may incur redundant information. Furthermore, existing studies only focus on entity-level reasoning paths without considering global interactions among entities cross-sentence. To these ends, we propose a novel document-level RE model with a GRaph information Aggregation and Cross-sentence Reasoning network (GRACR). Specifically, a simplified document-level graph is constructed to model the semantic information of all mentions and sentences in a document, and an entity-level graph is designed to explore relations of long-distance cross-sentence entity pairs. Experimental results show that GRACR achieves excellent performance on two public datasets of document-level RE. It is especially effective in extracting potential relations of cross-sentence entity pairs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UESTC-LHF/GRACR.  

### A Formal Metareasoning Model of Concurrent Planning and Execution
**source**: arXiv:2303.02664 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02664)]  
**abstract**: Agents that plan and act in the real world must deal with the fact that time passes as they are planning. When timing is tight, there may be insufficient time to complete the search for a plan before it is time to act. By commencing execution before search concludes, one gains time to search by making planning and execution concurrent. However, this incurs the risk of making incorrect action choices, especially if actions are irreversible. This tradeoff between opportunity and risk is the problem addressed in this paper. Our main contribution is to formally define this setting as an abstract metareasoning problem. We find that the abstract problem is intractable. However, we identify special cases that are solvable in polynomial time, develop greedy solution algorithms, and, through tests on instances derived from search problems, find several methods that achieve promising practical performance. This work lays the foundation for a principled time-aware executive that concurrently plans and executes.  

### A Multi-Grained Self-Interpretable Symbolic-Neural Model For Single/Multi-Labeled Text Classification
**source**: arXiv:2303.02860 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02860)]  
**abstract**: Deep neural networks based on layer-stacking architectures have historically suffered from poor inherent interpretability. Meanwhile, symbolic probabilistic models function with clear interpretability, but how to combine them with neural networks to enhance their performance remains to be explored. In this paper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a structured language model. We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to explicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without requiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language model learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only raw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes it essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach could achieve good prediction accuracy in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, the predicted span labels are consistent with human rationales to a certain degree.  

### Learning to reason over visual objects
**source**: arXiv:2303.02260 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02260)]  
**abstract**: A core component of human intelligence is the ability to identify abstract patterns inherent in complex, high-dimensional perceptual data, as exemplified by visual reasoning tasks such as Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Motivated by the goal of designing AI systems with this capacity, recent work has focused on evaluating whether neural networks can learn to solve RPM-like problems. Previous work has generally found that strong performance on these problems requires the incorporation of inductive biases that are specific to the RPM problem format, raising the question of whether such models might be more broadly useful. Here, we investigated the extent to which a general-purpose mechanism for processing visual scenes in terms of objects might help promote abstract visual reasoning. We found that a simple model, consisting only of an object-centric encoder and a transformer reasoning module, achieved state-of-the-art results on both of two challenging RPM-like benchmarks (PGM and I-RAVEN), as well as a novel benchmark with greater visual complexity (CLEVR-Matrices). These results suggest that an inductive bias for object-centric processing may be a key component of abstract visual reasoning, obviating the need for problem-specific inductive biases.  

### A Neurosymbolic Approach to the Verification of Temporal Logic Properties of Learning enabled Control Systems
**source**: arXiv:2303.05394 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05394)]  
**abstract**: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has become a popular tool for expressing formal requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The problem of verifying STL properties of neural network-controlled CPS remains a largely unexplored problem. In this paper, we present a model for the verification of Neural Network (NN) controllers for general STL specifications using a custom neural architecture where we map an STL formula into a feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation. In the case where both our plant model and the controller are ReLU-activated neural networks, we reduce the STL verification problem to reachability in ReLU neural networks. We also propose a new approach for neural network controllers with general activation functions; this approach is a sound and complete verification approach based on computing the Lipschitz constant of the closed-loop control system. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of our techniques on a number of examples of learning-enabled control systems.  

### Symbolic Synthesis of Neural Networks
**source**: arXiv:2303.03340 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03340)]  
**abstract**: Neural networks adapt very well to distributed and continuous representations, but struggle to learn and generalize from small amounts of data. Symbolic systems commonly achieve data efficient generalization by exploiting modularity to benefit from local and discrete features of a representation. These features allow symbolic programs to be improved one module at a time and to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can successfully process. However, it is difficult to design components that can be used to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like neural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules unstable. I present Graph-based Symbolically Synthesized Neural Networks (G-SSNNs), a form of neural network whose topology and parameters are informed by the output of a symbolic program. I demonstrate that by developing symbolic abstractions at a population level, and applying gradient-based optimization to such neural models at an individual level, I can elicit reliable patterns of improved generalization with small quantities of data known to contain local and discrete features. The paradigm embodied by G-SSNNs offers a route towards the communal development of compact and composable abstractions which can be flexibly repurposed for a variety of tasks and high-dimensional media. In future work, I hope to pursue these benefits by exploring more ambitious G-SSNN designs based on more complex classes of symbolic programs. The code and data associated with the reported results are publicly available at https://github.com/shlomenu/symbolically_synthesized_networks .  

### Deep symbolic regression for physics guided by units constraints: toward the automated discovery of physical laws
**source**: arXiv:2303.03192 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03192)]  
**abstract**: Symbolic Regression is the study of algorithms that automate the search for analytic expressions that fit data. While recent advances in deep learning have generated renewed interest in such approaches, efforts have not been focused on physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units associated with our data. Here we present $Œ¶$-SO, a Physical Symbolic Optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not only in eliminating physically impossible solutions, but because it restricts enormously the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be useful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to noisy data. We showcase our machinery on a panel of examples from astrophysics.
